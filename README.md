1. Place the ```run_tests.sh``` file and the ```fileTests``` folder in your project directory.
1. The script will automaticly compile all files in the directory, so avoid having 2 main files and such. You can disable the automatic compile by commenting the relevant line in the .sh file and compile it yourself (just make sure to call the compiled file ```wc.out``` and place it in the same directory as the ```run_tests.sh``` script.
1. You can change the number of test that will run by changeing the ```TESTS_TO_RUN``` variable in ```./run_tests.sh```. **The default is 600.**
1. Run ```./run_tests.sh```

We can't promise the tests are perfect, please let us know if you found any problems :)
